	// in language go we don't have try catch if something goes wrong their is nobody to catch that, the language design aspect you treat problems or error is something like variable , like true or false value this is was exactly comma ok syntax is.

	// short variable declaration := sometimes when you use packages like, bufio  etc.  you dont know what is comming up that exactly this short variable declaration :=  is designed.

/*
bufio Package in Go
- The bufio package in Go provides buffered input and output.
- It wraps around an io.Reader or io.Writer (like files, stdin, sockets, etc.) to make reading/writing more efficient and convenient.

ðŸ”¹ Why use bufio?
- Without buffering â†’ reading/writing happens one small chunk at a time â†’ slower.
- With bufio â†’ data is stored in memory temporarily â†’ fewer system calls â†’ faster performance.


ðŸ”¹ Commonly Used Types & Functions

- bufio.NewReader(r io.Reader)
Creates a buffered reader.

- bufio.NewWriter(w io.Writer)
Creates a buffered writer.

- Reader methods:
- ReadString(delim byte) â†’ read until a delimiter (like '\n').
- ReadBytes(delim byte) â†’ same but returns []byte.
- ReadLine() â†’ reads a line (without newline).
- Peek(n int) â†’ look at next n bytes without advancing.

Writer methods:
- Write(p []byte) â†’ write data.
- WriteString(s string) â†’ write string.
- Flush() â†’ force buffered data to be written out.

âœ… Summary:
- bufio is for efficient buffered I/O.
- Use NewReader for input, NewWriter for output.
- Always Flush() writers to push data out.
