/*

- A Read-Write Mutex (also known as RWMutex) is a synchronization primitive used in concurrent programming to protect shared resources while allowing multiple readers or a single writer, but not both at the same time.

- ðŸ”¹ Why we need Read-Write Mutex
- In normal sync.Mutex, only one goroutine can access a resource at a time â€” whether itâ€™s reading or writing.
- However, in many cases, reads are safe to perform concurrently, and writes are rare.

Thatâ€™s where sync.RWMutex helps:
- Multiple goroutines can read the shared data at the same time.
- When a goroutine writes, it gets exclusive access â€” no one else can read or write until itâ€™s done.
